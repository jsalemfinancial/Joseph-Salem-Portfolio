            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>
                I graduated from the University of Michigan-Dearborn with a B.S in Mathematics. My education provides
                me with a skillset suited for problem solving. Often times, I find myself being recruited to model
                and solve problems from various scientific and non-scientific fields; deductive reasoning and logic are my
                greatest assets, allowing me to quickly understand any topic, as well as allowing me to know where to begin researching
                in order to solve related problems.

                Currently, I strive to expand my mathematical knowledge together with my skills in various programming languages. It brings
                me much joy to use math for the betterment of the lives of others; namely, I enjoy automating the underlying structures of
                jobs and tasks. I have more recently expanded into using math for conducting anlyses; the richest source of data and knowledge
                which I find myself performing analyses on and studying is finance.

                My spare time is spent on a few hobbies: woodworking, healthy cooking, and videogames. I am a proud owner of a tablesaw
                which I built a stand for. A moderately healthy lifestyle is central to my identity, and one of my handy-work projects
                had involved transforming my bedroom into a food lab, where I have a cupboard for sprouting and fermenting foods and an
                in-door garden in my bathroom closet. I like to stay connected with my long time friends through videogames, and occassionally
                I derive joy from applying formulas and models to maximaze videogame mechanics.

            <h1>Project #1: Relative Strength Indicator</h1>

            <p>
                <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index">Relative Strength Index</a> (RSI) is a technical analysis tool first developed by <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Welles_Wilder_Jr.">J. Welles Wilder Jr.</a> and published in his book <em>New Concepts in Technical Analysis</em>. A copy of this book is avaible for free online and is a short and interesting read; you will find many other popular analysis tools/methods and the reasoning behind their construction. Wilder is often considered the "Father of Technical Analysis" for his contributions to the field.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Although technical analysis might seem as useful as astrology, it is in fact utilized by many hedge funds as its own strategy division. The RSI in particular is used to trade not only stocks, but (as was its original purpose) futures contracts (commodities) as well.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                The <span class="equation">$RSI$</span>, along with subsequent mathy notation in paragraph* is calculated as follows:

                <span class="equation">\[RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}\]</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, <span class="equation">$RS$</span> is the Relative Strength Factor and is the ratio of the <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average">moving averages</a> of upward changes and downward chasnges, where each move is calculated as follows:

                <span class="equation">
                    \[
                    price_{now} > price_{previous} \implies \begin{cases}
                        U = close_{now} - close_{previous}\\
                        D = 0
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                </span>

                <span class="equation">
                    \[
                    price_{previous} > price_{now} \implies \begin{cases}
                        U = 0\\
                        D = close_{previous} - close_{now}
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                The ratio is thus:

                <span class="equation">\[RS = \frac{EMA\left(U, n\right)}{EMA\left(D, n\right)}\]</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="equation">$EMA$</span> stands for Exponential Moving Average, which weighs a series of data (typically) using a factor of <span class="equation">$\alpha = \frac{2}{N+1}$</span>. Here, <span class="equation">$\alpha$</span> is called the degree of weight decrease or smoothing factor, and there is no "correct" value to use for any of the weighted moving averages. The value used for the <span class="equation">$EMA$</span> is such that it's centering is equal to that of a Simple Moving Averag (SMA).

        <h1>Project #2: Price Percentage Oscillator</h1>

        <p>
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppo.asp">Price Percentage Oscillator</a> (PPO) is a technical indicator that shows a ratio between a "short" and "long" moving averages, typically Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) relating to price. The periods of these moving averages can vary, but the typical formula is:

            <span class="equation">\[PPO = \frac{EMA_{12} - EMA_{26}}{EMA_{26}} \times 100\]</span>    
        </p>

        <p>
            Whenever the indicator is greater than 0, then the 12-period EMA, <span class="equation">$EMA_{12}$</span>, is greater than the 26-period EMA, <span class="equation">$EMA_{26}$</span>, by that percentage; whenever the indicator is less than 0, then vice versa.
        </p>

        <p>
            I incorporate a momentum indicator along with the <span class="equation">$PPO$</span> that is similar in style to the <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD">Moving Average Convergence/Divergence</a> indicator, wherein a <em>signal</em> moving average is used to assist in identifying convergence and divergence moves. I typically use a very short moving average for the signal line and visually judge the momentum of the trends by a colored area difference between the <span class="equation">$PPO$</span> line and the signal line.<br><br>

        <h1>Project #3: On-Balance-Volume Momentum Oscillator</h1>

        <p>
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-balance_volume">On-Balance-Volume</a> (OBV) is a technical indicator popularized by <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Granville">Joseph Granville</a> which tracks a relationship between price and volume.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="equation">$OBV$</span> can be calculated with the piecewise function:

            <span class="equation">\[
                OBV = OBV_{prev} + \begin{cases}
                    volume & close > close_{prev}\\
                    0 & close = close_{prev}\\
                    -volume & close_{prev} > close
                \end{cases}
                \]
            </span>  
        </p>

        <p>
            This adds up volume measures depending on whether the price closed higher or lower. The idea is to give a data value that helps to measure the importance/strength of price movements. It is based on the premise held by Granville that volume movements precede price movements; essentially, large movements in volume should cause large movements in price.
        </p>
		
        <p>
            My modified version of this indicator turns it into an oscillator by taking the difference between the <span class="equation">$OBV$</span> value itself and a short term moving average. This acts as a very basic filtering technique and allows for momentum analysis. Furthermore, long and short period moving averages are also added that analyze this new oscillating value.

        <h1>Project #4: A Better Linear Correlation Coefficient</h1>

        <p>
            Correlation is a simple (but dangerous) analytical parameter that can be utilized in a number of strategies. The simplest usable correlation analysis done on financial instruments is a measuer of linear correlation, which yields a parameter called the Correlation Coefficient. This parameter can can aid in determining whether or not a collection (usually pair) of assets share any directionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most commonly used parameter with financial instruments is the <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">Pearson Correlation Coefficient</a> ($/rho$). It is calculated as such:

            <span class="equation">\[
                \rho = 
                \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sqrt{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}}
                \]
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            While the parameter is "accurate" enough, most analytical programs tend to overlook a couple of things:

            - Data distribution.
            - Outliers and result significance.
        </p>

        <p>
            That is, the data should be approximately normal, and should contain no outliers. Furthermore, the signifance of the data should be tested due to the nature of noise in random/stochastic varaiables. The solutions to these issues is actually simple enough!
        </p>

        <p>
            Stock <em>price</em> data in particular is considered log-normally distributed; more precisely, larger moves in price are less likely to occur as the price of the asset gets smaller. While it is easy to get away with saying that large samples from stock price data will be approximately normal, the fact that stock price is assumed to be log-normal is actually a benefit; we can simply take the log of the price data!
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we may conduct a <em>critical value test on the t-statistic</em>, or t-test on the collected correlation coefficient. This can be done:

            <span class="equation">\[
                t = 
                \rho \sqrt{(n - 2)/(1 - \rho^2)}
                \]
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            The main problem I ran into when building these improvements came from TradingView's platform not having any built in Cumulative Distribution Functions or table for the <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution">Student's t-distribution</a>. However, a handy little approximation found in section 26.2.17 of <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~aps/research/projects/as/resources/AandS-a4-v1-2.pdf">Handbook of Mathematical Functions</a> aids us in calculating the probability values for normal <em>Cumulative Distribution Functions</em>, or <em>CDFs</em> for short. This is helpful because if we restrict ourselves to "large enough" sample sizes (convention is >30), then we may use a normal CDF in place of a t-distribution as an accurate practical application. The aforementioned approximation can be seen applied in the provided chart script. Extra points go to the readers who recognized the approximation as a Taylor series approximation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that while TradingView does have a "good enough" Pearson Correlation analysis script, the method in which this script is written also allows for ranking data and finding the <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient">Spearman Correlation Coefficient</a>.

        <h1>Project #5: Options Lab</h1>

        <p>
            Options contracts are a type of derivative security. We can fetch and analyze <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp">options-chain</a> data using the YFinance Python package. With the help of the pandas package, this program essentially gives a breakdown of the information granted by the <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black–Scholes_model">Black-Scholes Equation</a>. The Black-Scholes model is what underlies the pricing of options contracts world-wide. Although it is ill-suited for pricing American options, it is one of those scenarios where "good enough" is acceptably precise. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I tend to trade options strategies often in my portfolio. Most of my knowledge is built off of the book <em>Trading Volatility</em> by Colin Bennett. A primary factor I look for in options is the current <em>Implied Volatility</em>. Having taken a college course in Mathematical Finance, I know the tedium and complexity that goes into applying the Black-Scholes Equation. This is why we get computers and "good enough" approximations to do it for us!<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="">Newton Interpolation</a> is a simple approximation method that assumes the model at hand follows a <em>polynomial</em> (which applies in our situation) and calculates the coefficients of the polynomial using the derivative of the model and <em>divided differences</em>. If you recall Taylor polynomials, this should look very familiar! The program that I wrote utilizes four guesses and 100 iterations of Newton Interpolation to accurately approximation the Black-Scholes formula for the given option type. As you will notice within the script, the (partial) derivative is not terribly difficult to find when trying to solve for implied volatility; the different partial derivatives of the Black-Scholes Equation are known as <em>The Greeks</em>. An important relationship to note when performing this is <em>Put-Call Parity</em>, which helps when requiring to evaluate Black-Scholes during each iteration of the approximation. The relationship states:

            <span class="equation">\[
                C - P = D(F - K)
                \]
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, <span class="equation">C</span> is the call price and <span class="equation">P</span> is put price. The parameter <span class="equation">D</span> is the discount factor, which is calculated based on current interest rates and accounts for the returns missed by not allocating the price value into fixed-income strategies such as bonds. Finally, <span class="equation">F</span> is the forward price of the actual asset (the stock), and <span class="equation">K</span> is the options strike price. Note that forward price is tradtionally used as it "cancels" out with the discount factor. The forward price is essentially the return on the asset price given the return-on-investment rate of fixed-income strategies.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            After solving for Implied Volatility, the program then creates a table using pandas for analysis; A few more parameters are calcualted within the script. I calcualte for <em>Historical Volatility</em>, which is the actualized volatility of the asset, as well as the <em>beta</em> value and <em>Pearson Correlation Coefficient</em> for the asset's return price. Here, beta is simply the return that the asset gives compared to another benchmark asset; simply put it calculates that percentage that the asset performs compared to the benchmark.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            A custom but rudimentary <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp">Max Pain</a> calculation script using YFinance is also included in my repository which pairs well with this script!

        <h1>Project #6: Fun Data Sorting with Python and SQL in OSRS</h1>

        <p>
            This project uses Python to fetch item price data from the <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki">OSRS Wiki</a> and write them to an SQL database for queryingL; this is particularly useful if one wishes to host and process this data on a server, such as the service <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ge-tracker.com">GE Tracker</a>! While more advanced applications of the data stored in SQL databases exist, this project focuses mainly on the Python data collection/sorting aspect and the provided library that interfaces it with MySQL servers!<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The structure of the project is simple. First, we fectch the html page from the OSRS Wiki's endpoint which has price data sorted in JSON/dictionary format. Second, we use the pandas package to organize this data. Lastly, we write our own calls in Python to essentially conenct and write the data into a MySQL server. The actual implementation of the last step is a little wonky, but serves the purpose of demonstration well. With more time, I would like to revisit this project and create a comprehensive library of Python functions that allow more advanced manipulation of the MySQL server. Eventually, if I ever return to terrorize the <em>Grand Exchange</em>, I would like to create a personal application similar to the service that GE Tracker provides!<br><br>

            I collected some data from the aforementioned friend's closed=beta game session and eventually figured out the formulas for the parameters involved with the crafting system's random event. Of course, the World of Warcraft developers changed the system about two times before the official launch, but the core principals remained the same.

            This experience cemented my love for programming and applications development in general. I believe that if I were alive in a different time period, I would do well as a blacksmith; I derive great satisfaction from creating tools for the use of others or myself!

            That said, the project was not without challenges. Since this work reflects Jedith's brand, he had been quite demanding (in a positive sense) with the overall polish and features of the site. I learned skills that reached outside of the scope of web development, namely: communication, quality control, and creativity. Having to develop a few work-arounds and accounting for all possible confusions that may occur (that is, assuming the most user error as possible) had also been a tiring yet rewarding experience, and had pushed me to make implementations that would help secure the longevity of the project.

        <h1>Project #8: Michigan RD-108 Form Automation</h1>

        <p>
            My parents own a small car dealership and have to frequently fill RD-108 forms. My mother is usually the one responsible for handling all of the Secretary of State paperwork involved in closing a car sale. While the state of Michigan does provide an automated Adobe form that calculates the taxes, the nature of my parents' business has them provide incentives to their customers by combinding all of the extraneous costs of the sale into the final sale price of the vehicle, which is called the "out-the-door" price. This is a big tax-calculation headache, as not everything is taxable and some things can count as deductions. The Adobe form, sadly, does not perform the necessary calculations based on being given the end price.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the mathematics behind the calculations can be easily autoamted with a spreadsheet, my mother is not mathematically inclined and struggles with new technology (that is, anything not social media related). So far, she has managed to break three versions of the spreadsheet program that I had made for her, even with some of the new iterations including translations to Arabic (her first language).
        </p>

        <p>
            So, I embarked on a task to figured out the best way to make a solution that she could not possibly mess up. This proved challenging at first, as the form has some requirements about the way it should be presented; that is, it's best to turn in the form filled via Adobe's framework. I was certainly no Adobe developer, but the internet had a solution for me: pdf libraries. While I have used one in the past on a C++ project, the hardest part was finding an open-source/free library that meshed well with Adobe's form formatting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Luckily I ran into the library <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://pdf-lib.js.org">PDF-LIB</a>, which worked off of TypeScript and compiled in JavaScript. Despite the lack of a server-side, I decided to use this library in <em>Node.js</em> and using <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.electronjs.org">Electron.js</a> to build a web-like GUI. The main reasons for doing this revolved around offline access, familiarity of visuals, and ease of use. My mother can feel like she is using a browser program, without any of the distractions or hassels of a browser! Although this might seem silly and over-kill, you should see her working with tehcnology in the office.
        </p>

        <p>
            The programs section of my <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jsalemfinancial">GitHub</a> provides the key Electron files and the main script which accesses the RD-108 PDF file. Note that you will need to scaffold your own Electron project and install PDF-LIB along with its dependencies/node modules.

                    Mushrooms are my favorite ingredient to use. Macro-nutrionally, they're a good source of fiber and protein (called mycoprotein)! I especially like the micronutrients that certain mushroom types provide. Shiitake mushrooms, for example, are actually a good source of vitamin D, just leave them to soak in the sunlight before consuming them! Mushrooms such as Cordycepts, Reishi, and Chaga provide anti-bacterial compounds as well as immune system benefits- which are so prominent that they have actually been used alongside cancer treatments as supplements!

                    I enjoy the normal taste of mushrooms, and so prefer them minimally cooked. Simply grab some large portabella or white button mushrooms and pan steam them in shallow water/broth. Add salt and spices after the they begin to look glossy, and throw in a dash of butter at the end and flip the mushrooms around in the liquid. Add this to anything from salads to sandwhiches!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I prefer to get the majority of my protein from plants; that said, it's hard to maintain a good intake when you wish to remain active. This is why I like to make dishes centered around tofu. It's versatile and easy to flavor, even without excessive frying.

                    My simplest method of preparing tofu: press out some of the liquid or buy extra-extra-firm tofu, and then salt and steam it in a pan with some water or broth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My favorite nutritonal powerhouse: sprouts! I avoid most grain and legume products due to the anti-nutrient and allergenic compounds in them. Sprouts cover all macronutrients, and have a whole host of essentia vitamins and minerals that are usually not digestible or even present in non-sprouted products. The flavor of the plant is also accentuated after the sprouting proccess as well: try sprouted rye for example!

                    There is a wide variety of sprouted products to make and try. I tend to sprout legumes at home, but not everyone has the time for the proccess. Luckily there are plenty of products out there to try! A big health improvement move for people who don't want to quit bread is to try sprouted bread. I tend to buy Ezekiel 4:9 bread, but any flourless sprouted bread is good! Adding sprouted legumes to the list such as soy bean and broccoli sprouts is an inexpensive and easy step as well!

                    You can make a killer pizza with sprouted pizza sourdough! Just add sauce, cheese, your favorite toppings, and throw it all in an oven for 10-15 minutes.

                    The Standard American Diet (SAD) has an AA/EPA ratio of 11; that is, most Americans tend to consume more Omega-6 fatty acids than Omega-3. A leading cause of this is the heavy use of polyunsaturated vegetable oils in all manner of American food. It's not just the trans fats that we should worry about! This is why I tend to consume a lot of butter and ghee (clarified butter).

                    While ghee is mainly a saturated fat, it helps me cut down my polyunsaturated fat intake while also filling my macro fat needs while also being versatile to cook with! Contrary to old studies, new studies have proven that dietary fat and cholesterol intake is unlinked to artery health; it's the inclusion of excess carbohydrates that causes issues.

                    I tend to use Ghee as a substitute for cooking oils (cooking with polyunsaturated oils is a whole separate issue to discuss). It adds a deep rich flavor to chicken and fish dishes and sears them evenly! Add any spcies towards the end of the cooking process to add more flavor to the ghee.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the easiest sources of protein for humans to digest comes from eggs! They're versatile and quick to cook. I try to consume at least 5 eggs a week; good quality eggs are hard to get, though in my opinion, are worth the price! I tend to get my eggs directly from Michigan farms, but organic pasture-raised eggs (for example, Vital Farms sells these) work just as well!

                    I prefer soft-centered eggs that are still a little gooey (over medium). Just heat up a small amount of water in a pan with any sort of spices/flavoring to make a quick broth, bring to a simmer, crack the eggs on top, and cover. The eggs are usually done when a white film forms on top of the yolk.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Versatile and store well, root vegetables are some of my favorite vegetables to cook with. I require a decent caloric intake, and root vegetables fill that need on top of providing a large array of necessary micronutrients. Care should be taken however, as some root vegetables are consumed too often and are ill-prepared!

                    I tend to avoid potatoes in my cooking as they are a dense food, and the modern breed of the plant is high in carbohydrates and may contain some compounds that are not well tolerated; I will stil consume potatoes, but only if they are organic, boiled, and kept cold to maintain the starch structure (which is a good fiber for the gut). I will tend to also substitue potatoes with cassava starches (the stuff they make tapioca out of), as they tend to have more fiber and less agitants.

                    The most common root vegetables I consume, however, are low-starch ones. Carrots, Beets, Parsnips, Turnips, Onions, etc. They're cheap even when organic and they store well.

                    Try some beet stir-fry or parsnips soups!

                    This is probably as close to perfection as games have felt for me. The story format may not be to everyone's liking, but the quality of the gameplay elements can not be denied. Every aspect of this game from difficulty to emotional storytelling made me cry; as a single-player experience, this was my go-to for an entire month whenever I needed to escape and unwind. A milestone in game history.

                    If you like staring at spreadsheets and visualizing big numbers, this is the game for you. It first started off as a simple ARPG but quickly grew to be one my favorite games in terms of Replayability. The game plays more like a puzzle than a traditional video games; you are given an insanely vast toolbox to solve the complex and difficult aspects of the late stages of the game. One look at the skill tree itself will decide whether you'll shun this game or become addicted.

                    Gameplay: 9/10.

                    The only thing more impressive than how immersed this game gets me into mundane tasks is how how little drive space it takes. It takes me 10 seconds of downloading and installing to get lost for 3 hours hunting deer at the start of the game, which is impressive ROI. The gameplay is akin to a meditative state: the simplest and slowest of tasks feel rewarding and beating the bosses after hours of build-up is simply cathartic.
