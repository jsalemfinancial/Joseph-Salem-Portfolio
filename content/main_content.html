            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>
                I graduated from the University of Michigan-Dearborn with a B.S in Mathematics. My education provides
                me with a skillset suited for problem solving. Often times, I find myself being recruited to model
                and solve problems from various scientific and non-scientific fields; deductive reasoning and logic are my
                greatest assets, allowing me to quickly understand any topic, as well as allowing me to know where to begin researching
                in order to solve related problems.<br><br>

                Currently, I strive to expand my mathematical knowledge together with my skills in various programming languages. It brings
                me much joy to use math for the betterment of the lives of others; namely, I enjoy automating the underlying structures of
                jobs and tasks. I have more recently expanded into using math for conducting anlyses; the richest source of data and knowledge
                which I find myself performing analyses on and studying is finance.<br><br>

                My spare time is spent on a few hobbies: woodworking, healthy cooking, and videogames. I am a proud owner of a tablesaw
                which I built a stand for. A moderately healthy lifestyle is central to my identity, and one of my handy-work projects
                had involved transforming my bedroom into a food lab, where I have a cupboard for sprouting and fermenting foods and a
                grow lab in my bathroom closet. I like to stay connected with my long time friends through videogames, and occassionally
                I derive joy from applying formulas and models to maximaze videogame mechanics (as will be explained in the <em>Projects</em> section).

            <h1>Project #1: Relative Strength Indicator</h1>

            <p>
                <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index">Relative Strength Index</a>
                is a technical analysis tool first developed by 
                <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Welles_Wilder_Jr.">J. Welles Wilder Jr.</a> 
                and published in his book <em>New Concepts in Technical Analysis.</em> A copy of this book is avaible for free online 
                and is a short and interesting read; you will find many other popular analysis tools/methods and the reasoning behind 
                their construction. Wilder is often considered the "Father of Technical Analysis" for his contributions to the field.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Although technical analysis might seem as useful as astrology, it is in fact utilized by many hedge funds as its own 
                strategy division. The RSI in particular is used to trade not only stocks, but (as was its original purpose) futures 
                contracts (commodities) as well.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                The RSI is calculated as follows:

                <span class="equation">\[RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}\]</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, <span class="equation">$RS$</span> is the Relative Strength Factor and is the ratio of the
                <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average">moving averages</a> of
                upward changes and downward changes, where each move is calculated as follows:

                <span class="equation">
                    \[
                    price_{now} > price_{previous} \implies \begin{cases}
                        U = close_{now} - close_{previous}\\
                        D = 0
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                </span>

                <span class="equation">
                    \[
                    price_{previous} > price_{now} \implies \begin{cases}
                        U = 0\\
                        D = close_{previous} - close_{now}
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                The ratio is thus:

                <span class="equation">\[RS = \frac{EMA\left(U, n\right)}{EMA\left(D, n\right)}\]</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                EMA stands for Exponential Moving Average, which weighs a series of data (typically) using a factor of 
                <span class="equation">$\alpha = \frac{2}{N+1}$</span>. Here, <span class="equation">$\alpha$</span> is called the
                degree of weight decrease or smoothing factor, and there is no "correct" value to use for any of the weighted moving averages.
                The value used for the EMA is such that it's centering is equal to that of a Simple Moving Average (SMA).<br><br>

        <h1>Project #2: Price Percentage Oscillator</h1>

        <p>
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppo.asp">Price Percentage Oscillator</a>, or PPO, is a technical indicator that shows a ratio between a "short" and "long"
            moving averages (typically Exponential Moving Averages) relating to price. The periods of these moving averages
            can vary, but the typical formula is:

            <span class="equation">\[PPO = \frac{EMA_{12} - EMA_{26}}{EMA_{26}} \times 100\]</span>    
        </p>

        <p>
            Whenever the indicator is greater than 0, then the 12-period EMA is greater than the 26-period EMA by that percentage;
            whenever the indicator is less than 0, then vis versa.   
        </p>

        <p>
            I personally incorporate a momentum indicator along with the PPO that is similar in style to the 
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD">Moving Average Convergence/Divergence</a>
            indicator, wherein a <em>signal</em> moving average is used to assist in identifying convergence and divergence moves.
            I typically use a very short moving average for the signal line and visually judge the momentum of the trends by a colored area
            difference between the PPO line and the signal line.<br><br>

        <h1>Project #3: On-Balance-Volume Momentum Oscillator</h1>

        <p>
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-balance_volume">On-Balance-Volume</a> , or OBV
            is a technical indicator popularized by <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Granville">Joseph Granville</a>
            which tracks a relationship between price and volume.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            OBV can be calculated with the piecewise function:

            <span class="equation">\[
                OBV = OBV_{prev} + \begin{cases}
                    volume & close > close_{prev}\\
                    0 & close = close_{prev}\\
                    -volume & close_{prev} > close
                \end{cases}
                \]
            </span>  
        </p>

        <p>
            This essentially adds up volume measures depending on whether the price closed higher or lower. The idea is to give a data value
            that helps to measure the importance/strength of price movements. It is based on the premise held by Joseph Granville that volume
            movements precede price movements; essentially, large movements in volume should cause large movements in price.

        <h1>Project #4: A Better Linear Correlation Coefficient</h1>

        <p>
            Correlation is a simple (but dangerous) analytical parameter that can be utilized in a number of strategies. The simplest usable correlation analysis done
            on financial instruments is a measuer of linear correlation, which yields a parameter called the Correlation Coefficient. This parameter can
            can aid in determining whether or not a collection (usually pair) of assets share any directionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most commonly used parameter with financial instruments is the
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">Pearson Correlation Coefficient</a>.
            It is calculated as such:

            <span class="equation">\[
                \rho = 
                \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sqrt{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}}
                \]
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            While the parameter is "accurate" enough, most analytical programs tend to overlook a couple of things:<br><br>

            - Data distribution.<br>
            - Outliers and result significance.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            That is, the data should be approximately normal, and should contain no outliers. Furthermore, the signifance of the data should
            be tested due to the nature of noise in random/stochastic varaiables. The solutions to these issues is actually simple enough!<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Stock <em>price</em> data in particular is considered log-normally distributed; more precisely, larger moves in price
            are less likely to occur the smaller the price of the asset is. While it is easy to get away with saying that large samples from
            stock price data will be approximately normal, the fact that stock price is assumed to be log-normal is actually a benefit; we can
            simply take the log of the price data!<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we may conduct a t-statistic test on the collected correlation coefficient. This can be simply done:<br>

            <span class="equation">\[
                t = 
                \rho \sqrt{(n - 2)/(1 - \rho^2)}
                \]
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            The main problem I ran into when building these improvements came from TradingView's platform not having any built in Cumulative Distribution Functions or table for the 
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution">student T-distribution</a>. However, a handy little approximation found in 
            section 26.2.17 of <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~aps/research/projects/as/resources/AandS-a4-v1-2.pdf">Handbook of Mathematical Functions</a>
            aids us in calculating the probability values for normal CDFs. This is helpful becuase if we restrict ourselves to "large enough" sample sizes (convention is 30), then we may use 
            a normal CDF in place of a t-distribution as an accurate practical application. The aforementioned approximation can be seen applied in the provide chart script. Extra points go 
            to the readers who recognized the approximation as a Taylor series approximation.<br><br>
