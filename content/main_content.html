            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>
                I graduated from the University of Michigan-Dearborn with a B.S in Mathematics. My education provides
                me with a skillset suited for problem solving. Often times, I find myself being recruited to model
                and solve problems from various scientific and non-scientific fields; deductive reasoning and logic are my
                greatest assets, allowing me to quickly understand any topic, as well as allowing me to know where to begin researching
                in order to solve related problems.<br><br>

                Currently, I strive to expand my mathematical knowledge together with my skills in various programming languages. It brings
                me much joy to use math for the betterment of the lives of others; namely, I enjoy automating the underlying structures of
                jobs and tasks. I have more recently expanded into using math for conducting anlyses; the richest source of data and knowledge
                which I find myself performing analyses on and studying is finance.<br><br>

                My spare time is spent on a few hobbies: woodworking, healthy cooking, and videogames. I am a proud owner of a tablesaw
                which I built a stand for. A moderately healthy lifestyle is central to my identity, and one of my handy-work projects
                had involved transforming my bedroom into a food lab, where I have a cupboard for sprouting and fermenting foods and a
                grow lab in my bathroom closet. I like to stay connected with my long time friends through videogames, and occassionally
                I derive joy from applying formulas and models to maximaze videogame mechanics (as will be explained in the <em>Projects</em> section).

            <h1>Project #1: Relative Strength Indicator</h1>

            <p>
                <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index">Relative Strength Index</a>
                is a technical analysis tool first developed by 
                <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Welles_Wilder_Jr.">J. Welles Wilder Jr.</a> 
                and published in his book <em>New Concepts in Technical Analysis.</em> A copy of this book is avaible for free online 
                and is a short and interesting read; you will find many other popular analysis tools/methods and the reasoning behind 
                their construction. Wilder is often considered the "Father of Technical Analysis" for his contributions to the field.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Although technical analysis might seem as useful as astrology, it is in fact utilized by many hedge funds as its own 
                strategy division. The RSI in particular is used to trade not only stocks, but (as was its original purpose) futures 
                contracts (commodities) as well.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                The RSI is calculated as follows:

                <span class="equation">\[RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}\]</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, <span class="equation">$RS$</span> is the Relative Strength Factor and is the ratio of the
                <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average">moving averages</a> of
                upward changes and downward changes, where each move is calculated as follows:

                <span class="equation">
                    \[
                    price_{now} > price_{previous} \implies \begin{cases}
                        U = close_{now} - close_{previous}\\
                        D = 0
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                </span>

                <span class="equation">
                    \[
                    price_{previous} > price_{now} \implies \begin{cases}
                        U = 0\\
                        D = close_{previous} - close_{now}
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                The ratio is thus:

                <span class="equation">\[RS = \frac{EMA\left(U, n\right)}{EMA\left(D, n\right)}\]</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                EMA stands for Exponential Moving Average, which weighs a series of data (typically) using a factor of 
                <span class="equation">$\alpha = \frac{2}{N+1}$</span>. Here, <span class="equation">$\alpha$</span> is called the
                degree of weight decrease or smoothing factor, and there is no "correct" value to use for any of the weighted moving averages.
                The value used for the EMA is such that it's centering is equal to that of a Simple Moving Average (SMA).<br><br>

        <h1>Project #2: Price Percentage Oscillator</h1>

        <p>
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppo.asp">Price Percentage Oscillator</a>, or PPO, is a technical indicator that shows a ratio between a "short" and "long"
            moving averages (typically Exponential Moving Averages) relating to price. The periods of these moving averages
            can vary, but the typical formula is:

            <span class="equation">\[PPO = \frac{EMA_{12} - EMA_{26}}{EMA_{26}} \times 100\]</span>    
        </p>

        <p>
            Whenever the indicator is greater than 0, then the 12-period EMA is greater than the 26-period EMA by that percentage;
            whenever the indicator is less than 0, then vis versa.   
        </p>

        <p>
            I personally incorporate a momentum indicator along with the PPO that is similar in style to the 
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD">Moving Average Convergence/Divergence</a>
            indicator, wherein a <em>signal</em> moving average is used to assist in identifying convergence and divergence moves.
            I typically use a very short moving average for the signal line and visually judge the momentum of the trends by a colored area
            difference between the PPO line and the signal line.<br><br>

            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-balance_volume">On-Balance-Volume</a> , or OBV
            is a technical indicator popularized by <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Granville">Joseph Granville</a>
            which tracks a relationship between price and volume.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            OBV can be calculated with the piecewise function:

            <span class="equation">\[
                OBV = OBV_{prev} + \begin{cases}
                    volume & close > close_{prev}\\
                    0 & close = close_{prev}\\
                    -volume & close_{prev} > close
                \end{cases}
                \]
            </span>  
        </p>

        <p>
            This essentially adds up volume measures depending on whether the price closed higher or lower. The idea is to give a data value
            that helps to measure the importance/strength of price movements. It is based on the premise held by Joseph Granville that volume
            movements precede price movements; essentially, large movements in volume should cause large movements in price.

        <h1>Project #4: A Better Linear Correlation Coefficient</h1>

        <p>
            Correlation is a simple (but dangerous) analytical parameter that can be utilized in a number of strategies. The simplest usable correlation analysis done
            on financial instruments is a measuer of linear correlation, which yields a parameter called the Correlation Coefficient. This parameter can
            can aid in determining whether or not a collection (usually pair) of assets share any directionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most commonly used parameter with financial instruments is the
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">Pearson Correlation Coefficient</a>.
            It is calculated as such:

            <span class="equation">\[
                \rho = 
                \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sqrt{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}}
                \]
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            While the parameter is "accurate" enough, most analytical programs tend to overlook a couple of things:<br><br>

            - Data distribution.<br>
            - Outliers and result significance.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            That is, the data should be approximately normal, and should contain no outliers. Furthermore, the signifance of the data should
            be tested due to the nature of noise in random/stochastic varaiables. The solutions to these issues is actually simple enough!<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Stock <em>price</em> data in particular is considered log-normally distributed; more precisely, larger moves in price
            are less likely to occur the smaller the price of the asset is. While it is easy to get away with saying that large samples from
            stock price data will be approximately normal, the fact that stock price is assumed to be log-normal is actually a benefit; we can
            simply take the log of the price data!<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we may conduct a t-statistic test on the collected correlation coefficient. This can be simply done:<br>

            <span class="equation">\[
                t = 
                \rho \sqrt{(n - 2)/(1 - \rho^2)}
                \]
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            The main problem I ran into when building these improvements came from TradingView's platform not having any built in Cumulative Distribution Functions or table for the 
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution">student T-distribution</a>. However, a handy little approximation found in 
            section 26.2.17 of <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~aps/research/projects/as/resources/AandS-a4-v1-2.pdf">Handbook of Mathematical Functions</a>
            aids us in calculating the probability values for normal CDFs. This is helpful becuase if we restrict ourselves to "large enough" sample sizes (convention is 30), then we may use 
            a normal CDF in place of a t-distribution as an accurate practical application. The aforementioned approximation can be seen applied in the provide chart script. Extra points go 
            to the readers who recognized the approximation as a Taylor series approximation.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that while TradingView does have a "good enough" Pearson Correlation analysis script, the method in which this script is written also allows for ranking data and finding
            the <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient">Spearman Correlation Coefficient</a>.<br><br>

            Options contracts are a type of derivative security. We can fetch and analyze <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp">options-chain</a> 
            data using the YFinance Python package. With the help of the pandas package, this program essentially gives a breakdown of the information granted by the

        <h1>Project #6: Fun Data Sorting with Python and SQL in OSRS</h1>

        <p>
            This project uses Python to fetch item price data from the <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki">OSRS Wiki</a> and write them to an SQL database for queryingL;
            this is particularly useful if one wishes to host and process this data on a server, such as the service 
            <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ge-tracker.com">GE Tracker</a>! While more advanced applications of the data stored in SQL databases exist, this project
            focuses mainly on the Python data collection/sorting aspect and the provided library that interfaces it with MySQL servers!<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The structure of the project is simple. First, we fectch the html page from the OSRS Wiki's endpoint which has price data sorted in JSON/dictionary format. Second, we use
            the pandas package to organize this data. Lastly, we write our own calls in Python to essentially conenct and write the data into a MySQL server. The actual implementation of the
            last step is a little wonky, but serves the purpose of demonstration well. With more time, I would like to revisit this project and create a comprehensive library of Python functions
            that allow more advanced manipulation of the MySQL server. Eventually, if I ever return to terrorize the <em>Grand Exchange</em>, I would like to create a personal application similar to
            the service that GE Tracker provides!

        <h1>Project #7: A WoW Crafting App </h1>

        <p>
            This was a request from a friend. It started off as a simple calculator and turned into a full blown partnership with the World of Warcraft
            streamer/content creator <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/jedith">Jedith</a>. The web app, made for World of Warcraft's <em>Dragonflight</em> update,

            This experience cemented my love for programming and applications development in general. I believe that if I were alive in a different time period, I would
            do well as a blacksmith; I derive great satisfaction from creating tools for the use of others or myself!<br><br>

            That said, the project was not without challenges. Since this work reflects Jedith's brand, he had been quite demanding (in a positive sense) with
            the overall polish and features of the site. I learned skills that reached outside of the scope of web development, namely: communication, quality control, and creativity.
            Having to develop a few work arounds and accounting for all possible confusions that may occur (that is, assuming the most user error as possible) had also been a tiring yet
            rewarding experience, and had pushed me to make implementations that would help secure the longevity of the project.

        <h1>Project #8: Michigan RD-108 Form Automation</h1>

        <p>
            My parents own a small car dealership and have to frequently fill RD-108 forms. My mother, being more socially proficient than my step-father, handles all of the
            Secretary of State paperwork involved in closing a car sale. While the state of Michigan does provide an automated Adobe form, the nature of my parents' business has them provide
            incentives to their customers by combinding all of the extraneous costs of the sale into the final sale price of the vehicle, which is called the "out-the-door" price. This is big
            tax headache as not everything is taxable and some things can count as deductions. The Adobe form, sadly, does not perform the necessary calculations in this direction.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            While the mathematics behind the calculations can be easily autoamted with a spreadsheet, my mother is not mathematically inclined and struggles with new technology
            (that is, anything not social media related). She has so far manageg to break three versions of the spreadsheet program that I had made for her, even with some of
            the new iterations including translations to Arabic.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            So I embarked on a task to figured out the best way to make a solution that she could not possibly messs up. This proved challenging at first, as the form
            has some requirements about the way it should be presented; that is, it's best to turn in the form filled via Adobe's framework. I was certainly no
            Adobe developer, but the internet had a solution for me: pdf libraries. While I have used one in the past on a C++ project, the hardest part was finding an
            open-source/free library that meshed well with Adobe's form formatting.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Luckily I ran into the library <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://pdf-lib.js.org">PDF-LIB</a>, which worked off of TypeScript and compiled in JavaScript.
            Despite the lack of a server-side, I decided to use this library in <em>Node.js</em> and using <a class="u-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.electronjs.org">Electron.js</a>
            to build a web-like GUI. The main reasons for doing this revolved around: offline access, familrity of visuals, and ease of access. My mother can feel like she is using a
            browser program, without any of the distractions or hassels of a browser! Although this might seem silly and over-kill, you should see her working with tehcnology in the office.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The programs section of my GitHub provides the key Electron files and the main script which accesses the RD-108 PDF file. Note that you will need to scaffold your own
            Electron project and install PDF-LIB along with its dependencies/node modules.
